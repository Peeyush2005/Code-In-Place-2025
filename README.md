## 🌟 About the Course

**Code In Place** is a global, free-to-enroll course taught by Stanford instructors and volunteers. It focuses on:
- Writing Python code
- Problem decomposition and stepwise refinement
- Logical thinking and control flow
- Creative problem-solving through mini projects and challenges

🖥️ Official site: [codeinplace.stanford.edu](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu)

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### ✅ Week 1: Welcome to Karel 🤖

Karel the Robot teaches us **basic programming logic** without worrying about syntax.

**Lessons & Challenges:**
- `Warmup`: Move Karel forward and place a beeper
- `Karel's Home`: Guide Karel to its home
- `Jigsaw Karel`: Arrange Karel's actions to form a complete sequence
- `2025 Karel`: Spell “2025” with beepers
- `Piles`: Tidy up beeper piles with loops

🧠 **Concepts Learned**: Sequences, functions, basic loops, `move()`, `put_beeper()`, and `turn_left()`

---

### ✅ Week 2: Stepwise Refinement 🔍

This week focuses on **breaking problems into smaller parts** using helper functions and structured logic.

**Lessons & Challenges:**
- `Beeper Path`: Place beepers along a path
- `Stone Mason Karel`: Repair vertical columns
- `Fill Karel`: Fill a grid using logical patterns
- `Midpoint Karel` *(Optional)*: Place a beeper at the midpoint of a line (smart use of loops)
- `Checkerboard` *(Optional)*: Create a checkerboard pattern
- `Create Your Own Karel`: Get creative — design and code your own world!

🧠 **Concepts Learned**: Problem decomposition, helper functions, conditionals, nested loops

### ✅ Week 3: Introduction to Python 🐍

Transition from Karel to full Python! You begin coding with real syntax and tackle text, numbers, and randomness.

**Lessons & Challenges:**
- `Hello Name`: Use `input()` and `print()` to greet users
- `Sunrise Fill-in-the-Blanks`: Build custom prompts and string formatting
- `Dog Years`: Convert human years to dog years using a multiplier
- `Multiply Two Numbers`: Simple calculator using integer input
- `N-sided Dice`: Use the `random` module to simulate dice rolls
- `Haiku Generator` *(Optional)*: Generate random poetry with creativity

🧠 **Concepts Learned**: `print()`, `input()`, type conversion, variables, arithmetic, `random.randint()`
